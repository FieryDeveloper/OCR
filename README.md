# OCR


## APP IS LIVE AT :   https://cfc4-35-203-186-8.ngrok-free.app

### The code is basic and easy to implement, provided Colab notebook as well as Python file.

If you want to run on local ,Create folder OCR, then create virtual env using command: python -m venv ocr_env
Then to activate it:

cd ocr_env
cd Scripts
activate

Then go back to the OCR folder directory. You can just type ( cd .. ) to go to pwd.
Now you can install requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt
Then you can run the app.py using streamlit run app.py

Running first time will take time to load tensors.

Currently, I could test for images with very less data as Colab GPU Memory limit is a constraint.

### For example:

#### Input Image (op1)

![Input Image 1]((https://github.com/FieryDeveloper/OCR/blob/main/op1.png))

#### Output Image (op2)
